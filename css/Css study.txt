What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CSS Syntax
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.


CSS Selectors
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


Most basic CSS selectors.
The CSS element Selector
The CSS id Selector
The CSS class Selector
The CSS Universal Selector


The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element

The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

<h1 class="make large" id="he" style="color: rgb(18, 38, 218);">Welcome to hello world</h1>

#he {
  color: brown;
}

/* class selector */

.make {
  color: yellow;
}

.large {
  color: gray;
}

prefrence inline style is taking is first
second prefrence Id's
third prefrence class 
If you want override the prefrence set !important
Ex:-
.make {
  color: yellow !important;
}
having two class in same element which style it's taking 

<h1 class="make large">Welcome to hello world</h1>

.make {
  color: yellow;
}

.large {
  color: gray;
}

it will take second class style

The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

 <h1>Welcome to hello world</h1>
    <h2 class="make">steve</h2>

* {
  color: yellow;
}

.make {
  color: blue;
}
 which doesn't have anything in that time take universal style
other wise it takes particualr id or class style

The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
Grouping Selector
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
