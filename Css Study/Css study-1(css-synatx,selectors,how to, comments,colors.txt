What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CSS Syntax
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.


CSS Selectors
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


Most basic CSS selectors.
The CSS element Selector
The CSS id Selector
The CSS class Selector
The CSS Universal Selector


The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element

The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

<h1 class="make large" id="he" style="color: rgb(18, 38, 218);">Welcome to hello world</h1>

#he {
  color: brown;
}

/* class selector */

.make {
  color: yellow;
}

.large {
  color: gray;
}

prefrence inline style is taking is first
second prefrence Id's
third prefrence class 
If you want override the prefrence set !important
Ex:-
.make {
  color: yellow !important;
}
having two class in same element which style it's taking 

<h1 class="make large">Welcome to hello world</h1>

.make {
  color: yellow;
}

.large {
  color: gray;
}

it will take second class style

The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

 <h1>Welcome to hello world</h1>
    <h2 class="make">steve</h2>

* {
  color: yellow;
}

.make {
  color: blue;
}
 which doesn't have anything in that time take universal style
other wise it takes particualr id or class style

The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
Grouping Selector
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}


How To Add CSS

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

Note: Do not add a space between the property value (20) and the unit (px):
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (no space): margin-left: 20px;


Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

Multiple Style Sheets
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

h1 {
  color: navy;
}

h1 {
  color: orange;   
}

Example
If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "orange":

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
<style>
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
</style>
</head>

Example
However, if the internal style is defined before the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "navy": 

<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
</style>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>

Cascading Order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

Inline style (inside an HTML element)
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.


CSS Comments
CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
Comments are ignored by browsers


CSS Colors

Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, values.
CSS Color Names ex:- "Tomato" "yellow" 
CSS RGB Colors

RGB Value
In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:
rgb(red, green, blue)
Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).


HEX Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb #0000ff #3cb371

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
always it should be 6 charcter along with # symbol number range should be 0-9 alphabet should be a-f 
example :#ff0000 

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.
