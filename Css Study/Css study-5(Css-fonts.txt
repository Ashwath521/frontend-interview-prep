CSS Web Safe Fonts

What are Web Safe Fonts?
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

Fallback Fonts
However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.

Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property.
 If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on.
 Always end the list with a generic font family name.

Best Web Safe Fonts for HTML and CSS
The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS:

Arial (sans-serif)
Verdana (sans-serif)
Tahoma (sans-serif)
Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
Times New Roman (serif)
Georgia (serif)
Garamond (serif)
Courier New (monospace)
Brush Script MT (cursive)

Fantasy


CSS Font Style
Font Style
The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

normal - The text is shown normally
italic - The text is shown in italics
oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)

Font Weight
The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font:

Font Variant
The font-variant property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.

CSS Font Size
Font Size
The font-size property sets the size of the text

Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.

Absolute size:

Sets the text to a specified size
Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
Relative size:

Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
Allows a user to change the text size in browsers

Set Font Size With Em
To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.

1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.

The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em

Note:- ðŸš¨
Responsive Font Size
The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".
Resize the browser window to see how the font size scales.

<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width

CSS Icons


How To Add Icons
The simplest way to add an icon to your HTML page, is with an icon library, such as Font Awesome.

Add the name of the specified icon class to any inline HTML element (like <i> or <span>).

Font Awesome Icons
To use the Font Awesome icons, go to fontawesome.com, sign in, and get a code to add in the <head> section of your HTML page:

<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/yourcode.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/a076d05399.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body>

<i class="fas fa-cloud"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
<i class="fas fa-car"></i>
<i class="fas fa-file"></i>
<i class="fas fa-bars"></i>

</body>
</html>

Bootstrap Icons
To use the Bootstrap glyphicons, add the following line inside the <head> section of your HTML page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">


Google Icons
To use the Google icons, add the following line inside the <head> section of your HTML page:
<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud"></i>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
<i class="material-icons">cloud</i>


CSS Links
The four links states are:

a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:

a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
a:active MUST come after a:hover

Text Decoration

Background Color
