Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML

What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!


HTML Basic Examples

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

HTML Elements

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:

HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:


HTML Tag Reference
W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
At W3Schools we always use lowercase tag names.

Tag	Description
<html>	Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>	Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings

HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag

The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.


The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.


The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
